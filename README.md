# Hyperlink-validator

Hyperlink validator is a program used to check on the valid (unbroken) links and invalid links. It outputs the count of the valid and invalid links within a given url.
It does so by making sure the request to a link is granted with an HTML document.

How it works:

1- You enter the url you wish to check the link content of.

2-You enter the depth (cutoff) of how far the links you want to go (i.e: if you wish to just check on given link, the given link and the links within, or further in).

3- You enter the number of threads used to do this validation (this will affect the speed of the results). Maximum thread count is 8.

4- Press the Check button and the validation process will begin.
